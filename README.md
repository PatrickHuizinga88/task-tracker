# task-tracker

**Demo: https://patrickhuizinga88.github.io/task-tracker**

My first project made in React. 

With this task tracker you can add and delete tasks from a list. You can also enable or disable a reminder (pure UI). The data is static.

I made this application with the help of a YouTube tutorial. This made me understand some of the basics of React.
